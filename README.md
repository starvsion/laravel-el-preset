# A Boilerplate repo for presets

This package makes it easy to use [Element UI](http://element.eleme.io/) with Laravel 5.6+ with SPA. 

Element UI is a UI Kit and CSS framework that primarily designed for Vue. It includes the most commonly used UI components that looks modern, clean and easy to work with. It can be used as a replacement for Bootstrap, or work alongside Bootstrap. 

You can start using Element-UI with adding `el-` in front of UI elements (e.g. `el-input`, `el-button`).

### Fun fact
Element UI's parent company, is called `eleme`, which is one of the largest Chinese food delivery company similar to Uber Eats. Eleme means *Are you hungry* in Chinese. Eleme developed Element UI for their own use, similar to how Facebook developed React.

### Note

**Element UI** uses these following acronyms:  `element-ui`, `el`
